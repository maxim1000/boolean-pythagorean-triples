# boolean-pythagorean-triples
An exercise in optimizing solution for Boolean Pythagorean Triples problem

Detailed description canof the problem can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem

Shortly - color numbers from 1 to N in black and white colors so that there is
no completely black or completely white Pythagorean triples (a*a+b*b=c*c).

It's known that for 1..7824 (and smaller) it's possible and starting from 7825
it's imossible.

Here is an attempt to optimize checking of this fact.
